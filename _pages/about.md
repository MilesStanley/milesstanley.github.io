I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Washington (GPA: 3.96) with a passion for developing AI systems that are robust, fair, and explainable. My research sits at the intersection of machine learning and social impact, focusing on how we can build more reliable and interpretable AI systems.

Research Interests
======
My work spans several areas of AI research:
- **Robust and Fair AI**: Developing methods to improve model reliability and reduce bias
- **Explainable AI**: Creating transparent AI systems whose decisions can be understood and trusted
- **Interdisciplinary AI**: Applying AI techniques to solve problems in healthcare and accessibility
- **Computational Social Science**: Using AI to analyze social phenomena and public discourse
- **Natural Language Processing**: Building language models that better understand nuanced human communication

Current Research
======
I'm currently involved in three research projects:

**Make4All Group** (Oct. 2024 – Present)  
Working with Prof. Jennifer Mankoff and Ph.D. student Brianna Wimer on generative AI tools for accessibility. I'm leading the design of Generative Rationale-Guided Training (GRGT), a novel framework that improves LLM robustness by supervising the model's internal reasoning process through a teacher-student architecture.

**UW School of Medicine - NEST Program** (Nov. 2024 – Present)  
Collaborating with Prof. Rachel Umoren on medical AI applications. I developed efficient data extraction pipelines achieving 75% runtime reduction, and I'm currently building an NLP system using Llama 3.1 to automatically evaluate medical simulation transcripts.

**Rochester Institute of Technology REU** (Summer 2025)  
Completed a research project with Prof. Ashiqur KhudaBukhsh investigating "vaccine buyer's remorse" in YouTube comments. I created a novel benchmark dataset with 2,000 annotations from a politically diverse panel and fine-tuned multiple LLMs to detect nuanced sentiment in over 600k comments. This work has been submitted to AAAI 2026.

Publications & Presentations
======
- **Stanley, M.**, Datta, S., Kumar, A., & KhudaBukhsh, A. R. (2025). "Investigating Vaccine Buyer's Remorse." *Submitted to AAAI 2026.*
- **Oral Presentation**: "Investigating Vaccine Buyer's Remorse" at RIT Undergraduate Research Symposium (July 2025)
- **Poster**: "Improved Neonatal Heart Rate Measurement During Ambulance Transport" at UW Undergraduate Research Symposium (May 2025)

Teaching & Mentorship
======
Beyond research, I'm passionate about making computer science accessible to others. I co-lead a First-Year Interest Group at UW, helping 25 students transition to university life. I've also volunteered with Hour of Code workshops, teaching middle and high school students about programming and computer vision through hands-on projects.

Technical Background
======
**Programming Languages**: Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, Bash  
**AI/ML Tools**: PyTorch, Hugging Face (Transformers, Datasets), Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
**Developer Tools**: Git, GitHub, Docker, VS Code  
**Human Languages**: English (Native), French (Fluent)
