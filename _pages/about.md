Hello! I'm Miles Stanley, an undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of Washington, Class of 2026. I am deeply fascinated by the challenge of building AI systems that are not only powerful but also robust, explainable, and fair. My research interest is currently at the intersection of machine learning and social good, where I am exploring how we can apply reliable AI to high-stakes fields like healthcare and accessibility.

I am actively diving into research to see these concepts in action. As a research assistant with the UW School of Medicine and the Make4All group, I am learning how to develop tools that assist with neonatal care and create accessible flowcharts. I also had the opportunity to spend a summer as an REU researcher at RIT, where I investigated complex social sentiments in online discourse—a project that resulted in a first-author paper accepted to AAAI 2026. I really enjoy the process of tackling these open-ended problems and finding ways to apply technical skills to meaningful social challenges.

Beyond my studies, I love helping others find their footing in computer science, whether I'm co-leading a seminar for first-year students or volunteering with Hour of Code. When I'm not studying or working on a project, you can usually find me exploring the outdoors in Seattle, testing out new recipes in the kitchen, or relaxing with a good sci-fi novel.
