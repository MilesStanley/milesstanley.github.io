## Abstract

A significant gap exists in misinformation datasets regarding post-COVID-19 vaccination experiences, particularly "vaccine buyer's remorse". Understanding the prevalence and nature of vaccine regret, whether based on personal or vicarious experiences, is vital for addressing vaccine hesitancy and refining public health communication. 

In this paper, we propose creating a novel dataset gleaned from a substantial YouTube news corpus relevant to COVID-19 vaccination experiences. We categorize posts based on whether the experience is first-person or from a secondary source, and further categorize the source of the secondary accounts. We utilize LLMs to identify posts expressing vaccine regret, analyze the reasons behind this regret, and quantify its occurrence in both first and second-person accounts. 

This research aims to (1) quantify the prevalence of vaccine regret; (2) identify common reasons for this sentiment; (3) analyze differences between first-person and vicarious experiences; and (4) assess potential biases introduced by different large language models (LLMs) – ultimately, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of post-vaccination sentiment and informing strategies to address vaccine hesitancy.
